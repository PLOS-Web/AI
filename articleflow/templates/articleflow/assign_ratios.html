<h2>Assignment Weights: {{ state.name }}</h2>
<p>Ascribe weights to workers in each state.  Weights don't have to add up anything in particular, they're purely a relative metric.  Those with a weight of zero will receive no new assignments.  Setting everybody's weight to zero will result in the autoassigner not assigning anything to anyboby.</p>
